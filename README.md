Some JavaScript Practice

a) Experiment 1 - Cox and Cox  - Homepage
http://www.coxandcox.co.uk/
Replace the upsell element below the main image on the homepage with 6 thumbnails of magazines and a link to a category listing all these products.

b) Experiment 2 - Cox and Cox - As Seen In
http://www.coxandcox.co.uk/rusty-red-hens
Move "As Seen In" feature higher up the page as per wireframe. Show only the magazine covers initially (wireframe 1). On mouseover, show the magazine details as per wireframe 2. Behavior is exactly the same.

c) Experiment 3 - Lyle and Scott - Size Guide
http://www.lyleandscott.com/
Add an FAQ section to the size guide modal found on product pages. By default, questions are shown. If you click on a question, it will open the relevant response inline below that question. See attached copy in zip file.
